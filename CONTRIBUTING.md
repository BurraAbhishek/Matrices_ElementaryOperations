# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide an overview of how you can get involved.

## Reporting issues

Have you identified any reproducible issue? Want a feature request? Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible:

Before you create a new issue, please search in [open issues](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/Matrices_ElementaryOperations/issues) to see if the issues or feature request is already filed. However, note that issues that provide little value compared to the required effort may be closed. Before creating an issue, make sure that:

1. You list the steps to reproduce the problem to show that other users may experience it as well, if the issue is not self-descriptive.
2. Search to make sure it isn't a duplicate. [The advanced search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) may come in handy.
3. It is not a trivial problem or demand unrealistic dev time to fix.

## Feature requests

**When you're ready, [make an issue ticket](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/Matrices_ElementaryOperations/issues/new)** and link relevant, constructive comments regarding it in your issue ticket (such as a detailed Reddit post; linking to an empty forum thread with only your own commentary adds no value). Make sure that the feature you propose:

1. Doesn't rely on mundane assumptions. Non-technical people have the tendency to measure how difficult / easy a feature is to implement based on their unreliable instincts, and such assumptions wastes everyone's time. **Point out what needs to happen**, not what you think will happen.
2. Is **unique, if you're aiming to solve a problem**. Features that can easily be replaced by easier ideas have little value and may not have to be brought up to begin with.
3. Is **clear and concise**. If ambiguities exist, define them or propose options.

## Code formatting


These repositories use [prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting.

Pick a plugin for prettier (coc-prettier is good for nvim), or use yarn run format before submitting code.

Except for 4 spaces per indentation, the default prettier configuration is used. See [the prettier configuration file](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/Matrices_ElementaryOperations/blob/main/.prettierrc.json) in this repository for more details.
