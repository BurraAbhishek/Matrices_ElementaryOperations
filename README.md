# Matrices_ElementaryOperations
A website which allows you to play with elementary operations of matrices

## NOTE:
This website is still under development. When a functional build is fully tested, this site will be available on GitHub pages.

In the meanwhile, you can start using this website, but there are certain limitations as of now:
- Either git cloning or downloading the repository is required to use the site. It is currently unavailable in GitHub pages.
- At the moment, you'll need developer tools to change the matrix.
- The matrix is a two-dimensional array: `var m = [[R1C1, R1C2, ... R1Cn], [R2C1, R2C2, ... R2Cn], ... [RmC1, RmC2, ... RmCn]]`
- For example, to use `R1 = R1 + R2`, in your console, type `addRows(m, 0, 1)`.
- The default matrix included is the 3 X 3 identity matrix. To change it, assign another two-dimensional numerical array to variable `m`.
- The dropdown of options currently does nothing.

All these bugs will be fixed in upcoming code changes.
